# Introduction
The global pandemic has significantly impacted the airline industry, leading to a sharp decline in passenger satisfaction and overall business performance. As the industry strives to recover, it becomes imperative to understand the key factors influencing passenger satisfaction. This project aims to predict passenger satisfaction levels using a machine learning approach, leveraging a dataset split into training and testing sets. The goal is to classify passengers into categories of satisfaction, neutral, or dissatisfied, and identify the factors that are most indicative of these classifications.
